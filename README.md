## What is SoundBlender?
SoundBlender is a customizable soundboard where users can create audio environments to enhance roleplaying games, murder mysteries, or any other type of interactive story telling.

### Create Sounds
To begin, users can upload their Sounds and customize certain attributes, such as name, the initial volume, how fast it fades in, the order on the page, and if the Sound should be looped.  Users can then immediately preview their Sound and make adjustments if necessary.

### Create Collection
Create a Collection - a Collection could be a specific campaign of D&D you're running for youre friends, or perhaps a book you read to your kids at night.

### Create Scene
Inside the Collection, you would then create a Scene. An example of a Scene could be the players' first encounter with a band of goblins.

### Create Category/add Sounds
Scenes would then have Categories within. You may wish to separate the Music files from Ambience or group music files according to genre.
